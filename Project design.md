# Project: Automatic Fake News Classification Using NLP Techniques

## Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a system capable of automatically distinguishing between real and fake news using supervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The analysis will be conducted on a labeled dataset containing news articles categorized as either real or fake.

## 1. Introduction
Online misinformation is one of the most pressing challenges in the digital age. Fake news can significantly influence public opinion, politics, and public health. This project addresses the problem of fake news detection by applying NLP methods to textual data and evaluating different supervised learning approaches.

## 2. Dataset and Preprocessing
The dataset is publicly available at: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/ErfanMoosaviMonazzah/fake-news-detection-dataset-English](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ErfanMoosaviMonazzah/fake-news-detection-dataset-English)

It includes the following fields: `title`, `text`, `subject`, `date`, and `label` (fake/real). The main preprocessing steps will include:
- Text cleaning (removal of punctuation, stopwords, and lowercasing)
- Optional lemmatization or stemming
- Merging the `title` and `text` fields to form the input text

## 3. Classification Models
We will fine-tune a transformer-based model for binary classification (`fake` vs `real`). In particular, we will use **BERT** as the base model for transfer learning.

## 4. Evaluation
Model performance will be assessed using a standard train-test split. The following evaluation metrics will be considered:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Confusion matrix

## 5. Analysis
Misclassified examples will be manually inspected to identify model limitations. The analysis will focus on recognizing patterns in false positives and false negatives. In addition, we will explore:
- Visualization of text embeddings (using t-SNE or UMAP)
- Word clouds to identify recurrent keywords
- Error trends and possible correlations with news categories

## 6. Critical Discussion
This section will discuss:
- The most challenging content types for the classifier
- Ethical considerations and potential sources of bias in the dataset or model
