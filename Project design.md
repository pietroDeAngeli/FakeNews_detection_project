# Project: Automatic Fake News Classification Using NLP Techniques

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a system capable of automatically distinguishing between real and fake news using supervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The analysis will be conducted on a labeled dataset containing news articles categorized as either real or fake.

## 1. Introduction
Online misinformation is one of the most pressing challenges in the digital age. Fake news can significantly influence public opinion, politics, and public health. This project aims to tackle the problem of news classification by applying NLP methods to textual data, evaluating different supervised learning approaches.

## 2. Dataset and Preprocessing
The dataset is downloaded from: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/ErfanMoosaviMonazzah/fake-news-detection-dataset-English](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ErfanMoosaviMonazzah/fake-news-detection-dataset-English)

The dataset includes fields such as `title`, `text`, `subject`, `date`, and `label` (fake/real). The main preprocessing steps will include:
- Text cleaning (removal of punctuation, stopwords, lowercasing)
- Optional lemmatization or stemming
- Merging of the `title` and `text` columns for textual representation
- Text-to-feature transformation using:
  - **TF-IDF vectorizer** (baseline)
  - **Transformer embeddings** (optional, for advanced models)

## 3. Classification Models
Several machine learning models will be implemented and compared:
- **Logistic Regression** (simple and efficient baseline)
- **Random Forest Classifier** (robust and interpretable)
- **Fine-tuned BERT** (advanced model, optional)

## 4. Evaluation
Model performance will be evaluated using a train-test split. The following metrics will be considered:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Confusion matrix
- Optional: Cross-validation

## 5. Error Analysis
Misclassified examples will be manually inspected to understand model limitations. The analysis will aim to identify common patterns in false positives and false negatives.

## 6. Critical Discussion
This section will include:
- A comparison of the models in terms of performance and interpretability
- Identification of the most challenging content types
- Ethical implications and potential model biases

## 7. Future Extensions (optional)
- News analysis by `subject` category
- Visualization of text embeddings (e.g., using t-SNE or UMAP)
- Integration of metadata or social data (e.g., associated tweets, if available)
- Multilingual classification
